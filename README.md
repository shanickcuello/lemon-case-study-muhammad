# Lemon case study. Muhammad

**Case Study**

**First Stage**  
Implement a catapult entirely in C++ (no Blueprints allowed).  
This projectile must detach from the catapult and follow a uniform linear motion, reaching at least **X distance**, and must be configurable from the code.

Showcase your best skills in this exercise. This includes unit testing, SOLID, YAGNI, KISS, dependency injection, git strategy, MVC, MVVM, MVP, Decision Tree, FSM, anything you are proud of. The goal **is not to finish the case study**, is to **showcase your skills.**

Geogebra formula:

```
x(t) = x₀ + v₀ₓ · t
y(t) = y₀ + v₀ᵧ · t
z(t) = z₀ + v₀𝓏 · t − ½ · g · t²
```
